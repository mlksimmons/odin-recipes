    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Cook noodles according to package instructions, just until
         tender.  Rinse under cold water.</li>
      <li>Mix the sauce ingredients together. Set aside.</li>
      <li>Heat 1Â½ tablespoons of oil in a large saucepan or work 
        over medium-high heat.</li>
      <li>Add the shrimp, chicken or tofu, garlic and bell pepper. 
        The shrimp will cook quickly, about 1-2 minutes on each side,
        or until pink. If using chicken, cook until just cooked 
        through, about 3-4 minutes, flipping only once.</li>
      <li>Push everything to the side of the pan. Add a little more 
        oil and add the beaten eggs. Scramble the eggs, breaking 
        them into small pieces with a spatula as they cook.</li>
      <li>Add noodles, sauce, bean sprouts and peanuts to the pan 
        (reserving some peanuts for topping at the end). Toss 
        everything to combine.</li>
      <li>Top with green onions, extra peanuts, cilantro and lime
         wedges. Serve immediately!</li>

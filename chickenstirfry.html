            <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>3 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sesame oil</li>
            <li>1 green bell pepper, cut into matchsticks</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) can sliced water chestnuts, drained</li>
            <li>1 head broccoli, broken into florets</li>
            <li>1 cup sliced carrots</li>
            <li>1 onion, cut into large chunks</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring rice and water to a boil in a saucepan over high 
                heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until 
                rice is tender, and liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25
                 minutes.</li>
            <li>Combine soy sauce, brown sugar, and corn starch in a 
                small bowl; stir until smooth. Mix ginger, garlic, and 
                red pepper into sauce; coat chicken with marinade and 
                refrigerate for at least 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat 1 tablespoon sesame oil in a large skillet over 
                medium-high heat. Cook and stir bell pepper, water chestnuts,
                broccoli, carrots, and onion until just tender, about 5 
                minutes. Remove vegetables from skillet and keep warm.</li>
            <li>Remove chicken from marinade, reserving liquid. Heat 1 
                tablespoon sesame oil in skillet over medium-high heat.
                Cook and stir chicken until slightly pink on the inside,
                about 2 minutes per side; return vegetables and reserved 
                marinade to skillet. Bring to a boil; cook and stir until
                chicken is no longer pink in the middle and vegetables 
                are tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Serve over rice.</li>
        </ol>
